# Managing Remote Repositories

### Cloning Remote Repositories

Remote Git repositories such as those hosted on GitHub or GitLab can be cloned by using the `rrpm get` command as shown below.

```bash
$ python -m rrpm get github.com/pybash1/rrpm # notice that the https:// and .git are optional.
Fetching GitHub Repository
Successfully cloned repository in github.com/pybash1/rrpm
```

The above command clones the `pybash1/rrpm` repository to the directory `%USERPROFILE%\Projects` on Windows and `~/Projects` on Unix by default. this can be changed in the `config.toml` file.
