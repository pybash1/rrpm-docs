# The API

### The Extension Loader

The loader is a simple script that loads extensions one by one from the `ext_dir` as specified in the `config.toml` file.

The code looks like this

```python
def load_extension(path, name):
    sys.path.append(path)
    try:
        return importlib.import_module(name, package=path)
    except ImportError:
        return None
```

Hence, any extension that has the same name as other extensions the user already has installed or is part of the standard library, can cause conflicts. It is recommended not to name them so.

Every extensions must have a `Preset` class as shown below with an initialization function that initializes the `name` variable. The data of this variable is used as the name displayed as the choices in the CLI.

```python
class Preset:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Option Name"
```

The class must also have an `on_select` method which is called if the preset is selected. It must also accept a `repository` and a `name` as parameters.

```python
class Preset:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Option Name"
        
    def on_select(self, repository, name):
        # generate project
```
