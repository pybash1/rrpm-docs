# Overview

RRPM Extensions as of the latest release are simple.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although simple, extensions can be very powerful, so do not install or download extensions from unknown sources
{% endhint %}

Currently extensions can be made that add custom presets to the create command. I have plans to extend this to allow users to create extensions that add custom commands.
